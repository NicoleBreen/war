# War Card Game

A simple Python simulation of the classic "War" card game. Two players draw cards, and the player with the higher card value wins the round. In case of a tie, players enter a "war," where more cards are drawn to determine the winner. The game continues until one player runs out of cards.

## How to Play

1. Players are dealt 26 cards each.
2. Both players draw the top card of their decks.
3. The player with the higher card takes both.
4. If there's a tie, a "war" is declared, and additional cards are drawn to break the tie.
5. The game ends when one player has no cards left.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NicoleBreen/war.git

2. Navigate to the project folder: cd war

3. Run the game: python war.py
